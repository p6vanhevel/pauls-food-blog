Melt your butter over medium heat in a saucepan and then stir in sugar and flour. **IMPORTANT:** It is very crucial to incorporate them together like this. Remove from heat and let sit while you beat the eggs with an electric mixer on medium speed until fluffy (preferably 1 minute or more). Stir this into the buttermilk / vanilla mixture. Whisk in the Butter, Sugar, Flour mixture and pour into your prepared crust.
