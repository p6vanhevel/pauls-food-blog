- 4 Cups Flour (European flour prefferred

### Tomato Soup Instructions ###

Turn stove to medium-high heat. Add a dollop of olive oil to a stainless steel or cast iron pan. Add coarsely chopped yellow onions, celery and garlic. Sautete under tender. 

> **CHEF'S NOTE:** Ingredients should be coarsely chopped, because they will be added to a food processor or blender later on.

Add fresh tomatoes, 2 12 ounce cans of canned tomatoes, spicy sun dried tomato paste, garlic paste and pesto paste to sautete mixture. Mix and add whole basil leaves (25+), 2 cups of chicken broth, 1 cup heavy cream and half a stick of butter (salted or non-salted) to sautete mixture

> **CHEF'S NOTE:** Fresh from the garden, add a shitload of basil. Again add a shitload of basil (25 leaves).

Season with black pepper and cayenne pepper to taste, set to simmer and let cook for 10 to 15 minutes. Once the flavors have integrated, add sautete mixture to food processor or blender and blend until it reaches soup like consistency. Serve hot.

### No-Knead Bread Instructions ###

Take 4 cups flour, 1 teaspoon yeast and 2 1/2 teaspoons Kosher salt and add to 2 cups room temperature water mixture. Mix together until it reaches a dough like consistency. Once formed, flatten the dough into a rectangle (4 inches by 8 inches), put into a floured bowl and let rest in refrigerator for 12 to 16 hours.

Once rested, form dough brick and shape into a ball. Let rise at room temperature for 4 hours. Once risen, place in 500 degree oven, immediately reduce heat to 450 after putting the bread in the oven and let cook for 40 minutes. Once golden brown, place on wrack and let cool.

> **CHEF'S NOTE:** Bakers yeast is preferred, if you can find it. Create slits in the top of the bread so that it has room to expand.
